# Data files

This directory contains the data files used in the analysis. The data files are:

- `D.csv`: The data file containing the product portfolio matrix. The first column can be ignored.
- `A.csv`: The data file containing revenue differential data for each market.
- `J0.csv`: The data file containing ownership information by the two firms.
- `Dist.csv`: The data file containing matrix of distance from factory's product to market for Table 4.
- `IV.csv`: The data file containing the instrumental variables for Table 2.
- `random.csv`: The data file containing some random numbers from MATLAB for use in other languages.

The `random.csv` file is not used in any of the tables or figures. It is only for development purposes and can be used to generate the results from the paper in R or Python without having access to MATLAB.
